# Analysis of Energy Prices Data and Renewable Energy Production

## Description

This repository contains the code, data and documentation done in the framework
of a practice exercise for the class *Tipologia i cicle de vida de les dades*
from the *Master in Data Science* of the *Universitat Oberta de Catalunya*.

The exercise consisted in analyzing data using R language from different sources: *AEMET*'s API 
dataset (Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia) and together with *ESIOS* dataset (Operador del Sistema 
de Red Eléctrica).

**Disclaimer:** Express consent has been given by *Red Eléctrica de España*, the
source and propietary of the data, to perform this exercise and under no
circumstance they support the reutilization of the data. We express our
intention to use the data for the purpose of the activity and decline any
commercial interest in the use of the data extracted.

## Authors 

The authors of this activity are: **Esther Manzano i Martín** and **Albert
Queraltó i López**.

## Source Code

* **PRA2.Rmd:** contains code and explanation for the main analysis done on energy prices.
* **aemet_preprocessing.ipynb:** contains preprocessing data for AEMET dataset.
* **data/aemet_data.zip:** contains all data downloaded for AEMET dataset.
* **data/aemet_dictionary.txt:** contains dictionary especifically for AEMET dataset.
* **data/esios_dataset.csv:** contains ESIOS dataset preprocessed in the first assignment delivery for the same subject.

## Dataset

The data extracted from the website is stored in the folder **data**. The
data for AEMET dataset is stored in different format files, being those *.zip*, *.txt* and *.ipynb*. The data for ESIOS dataset is stored in *.csv* format as it was submitted for the first assignment delivery on this same subject. Both datasets contain several variables compressed in the dates from *01-11-2020* to *31-10-2022*.

ESIOS dataset was published in Zenodo and it can be accessed through the
following link: *https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7335618*
